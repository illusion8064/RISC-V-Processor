# RISC-V Processor Implementation

## Overview

This repository contains a **RISC-V processor implementation** developed as part of the **Introduction to Processor Architecture** final course project. The project includes two implementations:

1. **Sequential RISC-V Processor**: A basic implementation executing one instruction at a time.
2. **Pipelined RISC-V Processor**: A 5-stage pipeline architecture for improved performance.

Both implementations are written in **Verilog**, tested using **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)**, and waveform analysis is performed using **GTKWave**.

## Implementations

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Sequential RISC-V Processor

- **Executes one instruction per cycle** (no parallelism)
- Simpler design, easier to debug
- Basic modules include ALU, register file, instruction memory, and control unit

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Pipelined RISC-V Processor

- **Implements a 5-stage pipeline**: IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB
- **Hazard handling**:
  - Data forwarding for efficiency
  - Hazard detection for stall control
- **Improves instruction throughput** compared to sequential execution

---

## Design Specifications
The processor follows the **RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA)**, implementing a subset of its instructions. The design consists of the following key modules:
- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)** ‚Äì Performs arithmetic and logical operations.
- **Register File** ‚Äì Stores temporary values and operands for computation.
- **Control Unit** ‚Äì Decodes instructions and generates control signals.
- **Program Counter (PC)** ‚Äì Tracks the next instruction to be executed.
- **Data Memory** ‚Äì Stores and retrieves data during execution.
- **Instruction Memory** ‚Äì Stores program instructions.

The sequential implementation executes **one instruction per cycle**, while the pipelined version uses a **5-stage pipeline** for improved performance.

---

## Instruction Formats
The processor supports **RISC-V base integer instructions (RV32I)**. The instruction set includes:
- **R-type (Register-Register)** ‚Äì Used for ALU operations (e.g., `ADD`, `SUB`).
- **I-type (Immediate)** ‚Äì Used for immediate operations and loads (e.g., `ADDI`, `LW`).
- **S-type (Store)** ‚Äì Used for store instructions (`SW`).
- **B-type (Branch)** ‚Äì Used for conditional branching (`BEQ`, `BNE`).

Instructions are encoded in **32-bit format**, with specific bit fields for opcode, registers, and immediate values.

## Hazard Handling Techniques
In the pipelined implementation, hazards occur due to overlapping instruction execution. The following techniques are used for handling hazards:
- **Data Hazards**:
  - **Forwarding** ‚Äì Data is directly passed from later pipeline stages to earlier ones.
  - **Stalling** ‚Äì Introduces a bubble (NOP instruction) when forwarding isn't possible.
- **Control Hazards**:
  - **Stalling on Branches** ‚Äì Pauses execution until the branch outcome is determined.

By implementing these techniques, the processor minimizes pipeline stalls and ensures correct instruction execution.

| --------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Execution Speed | One instruction per cycle | Multiple instructions in parallel                             |
| Complexity      | Simple                    | More complex                                                  |
| Performance     | Slower                    | Faster                                                        |
